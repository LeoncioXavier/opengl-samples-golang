# OpenGL Samples

This is a collection of sample files/projects that show off how to do certain things in OpenGL.

I update this collection in my spare time as I learn more about OpenGL.
It is likely that some examples may be incomplete or a work-in-progress.

Currently, I aim to do most of these samples in the Go programming language.
